        <h1><span class="fleuron">❦</span> Lasse Liehu-Inui</h1>
        <p>Hi! I’m a software engineer by profession, mostly building web services, especially interested in spatial applications.</p>
        <p>Also a volunteer localizer of open source software into the Finnish language.</p>
        <p>I tend to be either at a computer, in a forest, or recently also exploring the built environment.</p>

            <summary>More about me</summary>
            <p>I believe in continuous improvement over sudden, big changes. Regressions happen and they are no reason to give up.</p>
            <p>Following the <abbr title="Keep It Short and Simple">KISS</abbr> principle, also in communication, is a nice but unattainable idea. But, the most important things are always simple, they say, and I try to believe in that.</p>
            <p>Sometimes humans are interesting even though machines are easier to communicate with.</p>
            <p>Discovery is a great word. It’s a great joy to discover new concepts and be able to connect them.
            <p>I seem to also enjoy performance optimization and understanding algorithms.</p>

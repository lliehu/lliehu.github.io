        <p>Also a volunteer localizer of open source software into Finnish.</p>
        <p>When I’m not at a computer, I’m probably in a forest or in a library.</p>

            <summary>More about me</summary>
            I believe in continuous improvement over sudden, big changes. Regressions happen and they are no reason to give up. Following the <abbr title="Keep It Short and Simple">KISS</abbr> principle, also in communication, is a nice but unattainable idea. But, the most important things are always simple, they say, and I try to believe in that. I am intrigued by humans although it’s easier to deal with machines. Discovery is a great word. Discovering new words and connecting them to memories is a joy even if I will use only a fraction of them. Writing my Master’s Thesis on benefits of reactive programming in localization, in my first language.
